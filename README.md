# Book recommandations
This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook that demonstrates how to build a book recommendation system using nearest neighbors. The goal of this project is to provide a basic understanding of how collaborative filtering can be used to recommend books to users based on their reading preferences.

## Introduction
Recommendation systems have become an integral part of many online platforms, helping users discover new content based on their preferences. In this project, we focus on building a book recommendation system using the k-nearest neighbors algorithm. The algorithm identifies books that are similar to those a user has already enjoyed and suggests those similar books as recommendations.

This project is a part of the FreeCodeCamp challenges from the Machine Learning with Python course: https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/machine-learning-with-python

## Methodology
The recommendation system is built using the k-nearest neighbors algorithm, a popular technique for collaborative filtering. The steps involved are as follows:

Data Preprocessing: Clean and preprocess the dataset, handling any missing values or inconsistencies.
Feature Engineering: Extract relevant features from the dataset, such as book attributes or user behavior indicators.
Nearest Neighbors: Utilize the k-nearest neighbors algorithm to identify books that are similar to the user's preferred books.
Recommendation Generation: Based on the identified similar books, generate a list of book recommendations for the user.

## Results
The Jupyter Notebook demonstrates the implementation of the k-nearest neighbors book recommendation system. It showcases the effectiveness of collaborative filtering in suggesting books based on user preferences.
